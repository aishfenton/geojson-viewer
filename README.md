GeoJSON viewer
==============

This tool allows you to visualize a simple GeoJSON on top of Google Maps. 
Currently is able to parse simple polygons such as
the ones that Apple Maps accepts.

## Why?

I made this because there were no online solutions that I liked and I wanted to test some polygons for Apple Maps
